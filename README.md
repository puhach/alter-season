# Alter Season 

This project showcases the ability of generative adversarial networks to make summer pictures look like they were taken in winter and vice versa. It consists of three parts:

1. [Alter Season Model](./model/README.md)

	Builds a CycleGAN model for image-to-image translation. 


2. [Alter Season CLI](./app/alter-season-cli/README.md)

	Implements a simple command line utility which takes in a path to a model artifact and an image for conversion. 


2. [Alter Season GUI](./app/alter-season-qt-widgets/README.md)

	Implements the application allowing a user to select, view, and convert images by means of a graphical interface.
